      Hi there, and welcome to my portfolio! I’m NGQABUTHO, a learner-focused frontend developer with a curious mind and a growing toolkit.
      My journey into tech began in 2022 as a Data Capturer. That role taught me the importance of clean data and reliable systems —
      and sparked my interest in how digital platforms work behind the scenes.<br><br>
      In 2024, I completed high school and jumped into software development. By 2025, I joined JVR as a QA Tester, started studying Software Engineering,
      and leveled up my workplace skills like communication and collaboration.<br><br>
      Today, I build with Angular and TypeScript and explore backend tools like .NET and SQL.
      This portfolio shows how I grow by experimenting, solving real-world problems, and documenting the process honestly.
