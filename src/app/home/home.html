    Hello and welcome! I’m Ngqabutho — a junior software engineer, problem-solver, and lifelong learner with a passion for building systems that make life easier, smarter, and more connected.<br>
    This portfolio is more than just a showcase of my work; it’s a reflection of the journey I’ve taken, the challenges I’ve embraced, and the vision I’m shaping for the future.<br>
    Every line of code I write is part of a larger story — one that began with curiosity and continues with purpose.<br>
    From my early days in data capture to my current focus on backend development, I’ve learned that great systems aren’t just built with logic — they’re built with empathy, clarity, and a deep respect for the user experience.<br>
    As a junior engineer, I’m constantly exploring new tools, refining my problem-solving approach, and documenting my process in ways that make learning accessible to others.<br>
    Whether I’m working with .NET, SQL, or diving into frontend frameworks like Angular, I approach each project as an opportunity to grow and to share what I’ve learned.<br>
    This Portfolio is to guide you through that journey.<br>
    You’ll find snapshots of my career path, detailed breakdowns of the projects I’ve built, and honest reflections on what worked, what didn’t, and why it mattered.<br>
    It’s a space for learners, collaborators, and anyone curious about how thoughtful engineering can shape meaningful solutions.<br>
    So take your time, explore freely, and feel welcome.<br>
    I built this portfolio not just to present my skills — but to invite you into the process of learning, building, and growing together.
