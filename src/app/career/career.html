  <h1>ðŸ’¼ My Career Journey</h1>
  <p>
    My career in tech began in 2022, not with code, but with data. I joined JVR as a <strong>Data Capturer</strong>, where I learned the value of precision, consistency, and clean inputs.
    That role taught me how foundational reliable data is to any system â€” and it sparked my curiosity about the digital frameworks behind the scenes.

    In 2024, after completing high school, I made a bold leap into software development. I enrolled in a <strong>Workplace Readiness Program</strong> that sharpened my communication, collaboration, and professional mindset.
    Around the same time, I transitioned into a <strong>QA Tester</strong> role at JVR, where I began to understand the importance of testing, debugging, and user experience.
    QA taught me how to think critically, spot patterns, and advocate for clarity â€” skills I now carry into every project I build.

    By 2025, I had fully embraced my path as a junior software engineer. I began studying <strong>Software Engineering</strong> formally and started building with <strong>Angular</strong> and <strong>TypeScript</strong>.
    I also began exploring backend tools like <strong>.NET</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong>, documenting my learning process to help others follow along.
    My focus shifted toward creating beginner-friendly workflows, writing clear documentation, and making technical concepts more accessible to new developers.

  <p>
    Today, Iâ€™m driven by a simple but powerful goal: to build systems that solve real problems and to share what I learn in ways that uplift others.
    Whether Iâ€™m resolving Git conflicts, troubleshooting SQL connections, or teaching TypeScript datatypes, I approach each task with humility, curiosity, and a commitment to clarity.

    My career is still unfolding â€” and every step is a chance to grow, reflect, and contribute. This section is a living record of that journey.
